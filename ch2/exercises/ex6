It is not a good idea for an identifier to contain more than one adjacent underscore, such as "current__balance" because one could easily miss that there are 2 underscores side-by-side at first glance, making for a headache when attempting to debug the program.  This would mainly apply to programmers working on other people's projects since the original programmer of that variable probably knew there were two underscores in the first place.
