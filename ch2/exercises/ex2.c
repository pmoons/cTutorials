/*
A) The directives in this program are the #include <stdio.h> on line 1.  Directives are the commands intended for the preprocessor.  The directive itself is the #include command, while the header is the <stdio.h> portion of the command.

The statements in this program is everything between the {} "french" braces.

B) I hypothesize that the ouput will be:
Parkinson's Law:
Work expands so as to fill the time
available for its completion.
